                        Worked in a project setting to create web-based dashboard to display environmental data 
                        collected from Arduino sensors. Contributions to the team included writing the code for 
                        configuration of the Arduino sensors and writing the Python script that would send data 
                        to the web dashboard. The project repo can be found here for more detailed information on 
                        the project:

                        This project is a Chest X-Ray image classifier written in C++; using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
                        X-Ray image dataset used from Kaggle was used to train and test the model for classification. This 
                        project is still a work in progress but more information can be found on my GitHub below!

                        A personal project to better understand how operating systems work. This project is written in C 
                        and is meant to simulate the virtual to physical address translation process that occurs within 
                        the operating system. This project is still a work in progress but check out what I have written 
                        so far below:
